<p>You can scan exam papers using your smartphones easily. If you have a scanner machine, you can use that without giving it a second thought since they're much faster. This guide is for people <span style="font-weight: bolder;">who want to scan the papers using their smartphones.</span><br></p><p>If you've conducted your exam successfully, there's one step left: transferring the papers to Paper Grading. Paper Grading can grade your papers with nearly 100% accuracy. For this, you need to transfer physical exam papers to digital as highest quality as possible. To achieve this, please consider these general rules below:</p><ul><li>Scan papers <span class="vurgu">in the brightest part of the room.</span> This is very important. If possible, <span class="vurgu">scan them directly under a light or sunlight.</span> </li><li><span class="vurgu">Don't shake phone camera while scanning.</span> Shaken photo means no information can be extracted from that image. Don't forget that if you don't have enough light when you scan, your camera can shake without you noticing.</li><li><span class="vurgu">Scan the papers in order,</span> this is also extremely important. If your exam has more than one side, don't mix the order of students. It should go like this: <span class="font-italic">"Student1-First Side.jpg, Student1-Second Side.jpg"</span> and so on. Don't forget that Paper Grading grades papers in order. </li></ul><p>This guide is divided into two categories: Android and iOS smartphones.
