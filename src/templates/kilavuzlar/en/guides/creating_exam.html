If you upload another file with the same name in another question, the images you originally uploaded may change. Therefore, it is recommended to give numbers to the images. For example: <i>Question1-Image1.jpg, Question1-Image2.jpg, Question5-Image1.jpg</i>&nbsp;, <i>Question6-Image1.jpg</i>.</span></p><p>After uploading images, you can specify how the options will be placed under <b>"Options Layout"</b> setting.</p><p><b>"Add Formula"</b> option lets you draw a maths or chemistry formula with your mouse so that you can add it as an option.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_8.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy" style="width: 50%;"></p> <h3 id="ce_matching">Adding Matching Question</h3><hr /><p>Let's look at how we can add matching questions. After writing a question statement, you can add a set of matching items clicking <b>"+"</b> button which is on the right side of the default set.</p><p><span class="vurgu"><b>Reminder</b>: You can't add more than 11 sets. For now, Paper Grading can identify A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K letters.</span></p><p>After you've done, click <b>Update</b> button which is on the right top of your screen to transfer that question to the exam paper.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_9.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy"></p><p><b>"Put the questions one under the other"</b> setting lets you place every matching set one under the other.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_10.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="ce_true_false">Adding True False Question</h5><hr /><p>Adding true false questions is pretty straightforward. After choosing true false question, write the question statement in the first field, after that add a set of true-false question clicking <b>"+"</b> button which is next to the default set. You can add as many as true-false sets as you want.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_11.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="ce_gap_filling">Adding Gap Filling Question</h3><hr /><p>When you add gap filling question, you will see three fields. As we already know, the first field is for question statement.</p><p>Second field is for helper words for students to get tips from <span class="vurgu">which is totally optional.</span> For example you can write: </p><p><i>article - story - interview - anectode</i></p><p>as helper words for students to choose from.</p><p>For gaps that should be filled by students, you need to use underscores ( ______ ) in the third field.</p><p><span class="vurgu"><b>Reminder</b>: Please use at least three underscores. Nothing except for underscores will be identified as a gap question in Paper Grading. For example: </span></p><p><span class="vurgu margin-left: 50px;"><b>CORRECT:</b> Capital city of England is _________. </span></p><p><span class="vurgu">This is a correct way of adding a gap filling question but for instance if you put dots instead of underscores,&nbsp;<u>Paper Grading will not understand that this is a gap filling question:</u></span></p><p><span class="vurgu margin-left: 50px;"> <b>WRONG:</b> Capital city of England is ..............</span></p><p>You can look at the image below as a true example. If you don't see brackets around your gap, it means that you've made a mistake.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_12.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="ce_image">Adding An Image</h3><hr /><p>You can also add images to your exam papers. Don't forget this rule as we've mentioned before: every image you upload should have an unique name, or else your exam paper will go crazy.</p><p><img src="/static/guides/en_ce_13.webp" class="editor_img" loading="lazy" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p>Adding an image is very easy as well. Via the upload button which pops up when you click add image button, choose the image from your computer and hit Update button to transfer that onto your exam paper.
